#IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing
##Xih55@pitt.edu

    1.Using a appropriate object-oriented design
        1. I have designed all classes Separately.
        2. Constant class to store constant variables.
        3. Visitor class for visitors:like_dislike() displayleave() method.
        4. Generator class for random number generation.
  
    2.Test Design
        1. 4 Test classes for tatal 7 tests (BloggerTest StudentTest VisitorTest and CitySim9002Test)
        2. The test cotains edge case(input = 10) in CitySim9002 Test.
        3. In the CitySim9002Test, both doubles and stub are used.
  
    The most difficult part in this project is how to design and write the test code.
    Additionally, I did not write generateVisitor() method in Citysim9002 successfully in the very beginning, which should         return the right type of visitors, because of misunderstanding of it.

    All results are in the folder "TestResults".
