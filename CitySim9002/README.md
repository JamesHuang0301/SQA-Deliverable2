IS2545 - DELIVERABLE 2: Unit Testing
Xih55@pitt.edu

1.Using a appropriate object-oriented design
  1. I have designed all classes Separately.
  2. Constant class to store constant variables.
  3. Visitor class for visitors:like_dislike() displayleave() method.
  4. Generator class for random number generation.
  
2.Design Test
  1. 4 Test classes for tatal 7 tests (BloggerTest StudentTest VisitorTest and CitySim9002Test)
  2. The test cotains edge case(input = 10) in CitySim9002 Test.
  3  In the CitySim9002Test, both doubles and stub are used.
  
The most difficult part in this project is how to design and write the test code.
Additionally, I did not write generateVisitor() method in Citysim9002 in the very beginning which should return the right type of visitors.

All results are in the folder "TestResults".
